# User Stories

### As a market researcher...

* I want to know the rank of a group of products so I can determine their relative popularity.
* I want to keep the focus group participants as neutral as possible so the test results carry as little bias as possible.
* I want data analytics so I can make a good report to provide marketing guidance.
* I want to be able to change the products in the future, or maybe change the number of products tested at once.

### As a focus group participant...

* I want a clean, clear UX to make using the ranking app easier and more pleasant.
* I want to see my own results at the end, so I can learn about myself (and maybe find a new favorite product!).
* I want the images side-by-side, big enough to clearly make out what they are, so I don't have any question about what I'm picking.
* I want to be able to choose my favorite products so that the magazines I'm stuck reading on the bus is full of things I'm interested in.

### As a developer...

* I want to make data management easier by using a constructor function which automatically creates an array of objects.
* I want to use the objects to store all the data about themselves, such as number of times clicked and shown, to make doing calculations on them easier.
* I want to create a web app which shown image in a randomly non-repeating, non-duplicating order to show understanding of state variables
* I want to use good version control practices to keep my features and changes organized and understandable, and so that I can roll things back and do something different, if necessary.
